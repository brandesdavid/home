Hello! I'm a software developer from Berlin,  
19 years old and always staying curious.



#### About me

From my earliest memories, I found joy in disassembling toys, exploring the intricate springs and gears within, captivated by the mysteries of their inner workings. This childhood curiosity planted the seeds for a lifelong fascination with understanding the "why" and "how" behind everything.

As I matured, so did my passion. The world of coding and technology beckoned, offering a vast playground for exploration. Yet, what sets me apart is that I never lost that innate curiosity for discovering new things.

Today, as I reflect on my journey, I realize that my true calling lies in the realm of software development. It's not merely about writing lines of code; it's about untangling complexity, solving intricate problems, and collaborating with diverse minds in a team setting.

In every line of code, I see an opportunity to bridge the gap between imagination and reality. The dream that fueled my childhood tinkering has evolved into a commitment to creating meaningful solutions. Becoming a software developer isn't just a goalâ€”it's the realization of a dream that has been nurtured by a lifelong love for exploration and problem-solving.

Join me on this journey where the curiosity of a child meets the expertise of a developer, and together, we turn dreams into digital reality.
